# Code Book

The run_analysis.R file downloads data set, prepares data, and follows the 5 steps as required by the course project assignment. 

#### Download the dataset
   + Downloads the dataset a zip file.
   
#### Unzip the dataset
   
1. #### Reads data set and assigns to variables
   1.1. features: The features in this dataset is collected from the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope in Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone. 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50 Hz was captured. (561 columns, 2 rows)
   
   1.2. activities: List of activities performed (1. WALKING, 2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4. SITTING, 5. STANDING, 6.LAYING).
   (6 rows, 2 columns)
   
   1.3: Reading training data
   + X_train: Recorded features of training data. (7352 rows, 561 columns)
   + Y_train: Activity code of training data. (7352 rows, 1 column)
   + sub_train: Training data of volunteer subject observed. Total subject= 30. 70% for training. Training subject= 21. (7352       rows, 1 column)
   
   1.4: Reading test data
   + X_test: Recorded features of test data. (2947rows, 561 columns)
   + Y_test: Activity code of test data. (2947rows, 1 column)
   + sub_test: Test data of volunteer subject observed. Total subject= 30. 30% for test. Test subject= 9 (2947rows, 1 column)
   
   1.5 Merges the training and test dataset
   + X_total: Using rbind() function X_train and X_test is merged. created (10299 rows, 561 columns)
   + Y_Total: Using rbind() function Y_train and Y_test is merged. created (10299 rows, 1 column)
   + sub_all: Using rbind() function sub_train and sub_test is merged. created (10299 rows, 1 column)
   + merge_data: Using cbind() function X_total, Y_total, sub_all is merged creating 10299 rows and 563 columns
   
2. #### Extracts only the measurement on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    + Extracts measurement on mean and standard deviation (std) features for each measurement in X_total. 

3. #### Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
     + Assigns column names to Y_total as "activityID".

4. #### Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
     + Assigns column names to X_total with respective features. 
     + Assigns column names to sub_all as "subjectID"
    
5. #### From the data set in step 4, creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each  activity and each subject. 
    + tidy_data (180 rows, 81 columns) is created by grouping activity and each subject, and taking the mean of each variable. 
    + Export tidy_data into tidy_data.txt file
