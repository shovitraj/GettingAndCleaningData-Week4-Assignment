## Introduction

Wearable gadgets are flooding our markers and wearable computing has become the most exciting area in the data sience field. Manufacturers of these technologies are developing the most advanved algoriths to attract new users. run_analysis.R file contains the code that analyzes data collected with embedded accelrometer and gyroscope from the Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. 

30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years helped carry out the expreiments with six different activities wearing Samsung Galaxy S II phone on their waist. Dataset collected from 70% volunteers was selected for generating training data and 30% as test data. 

A video experiment can be found at this [link](https://youtu.be/XOEN9W05_4A).


## Analysis

run_analysis.R file contains the code that analyzes dataset in the 5 steps as following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Code can be launched in any IDE that supports R.
